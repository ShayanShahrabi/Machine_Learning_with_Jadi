For this project, we have prepared the information of about 4000 apartments in Tehran. All data is completely real. Your task is to estimate the price of dollars or tomans using the features of the dataset that will be explained below. The data is stored in the `housePrice.csv` file.

 - House size in meters (Area)
 - number of bedrooms (Room)
 - Is there a parking lot or not? (Parking)
 - Does it have a warehouse or not? (Warehouse)
 - Does it have an elevator or not? (Elevator)
 - An approximate address in Tehran (Address)
 - price in tomans (Price)
 - Price in dollars (Price(USD))

In this dataset, the houses do not have addresses, and the size of the houses is entered incorrectly (they have a very large value). For this purpose, you must manage these items and remove them from your dataset.
