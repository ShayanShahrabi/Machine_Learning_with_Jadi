# Project description
In this project, you have to build a recommender system. The data is related to the movies on the IMDB website. There are two files, one is the list of movies and their genre, and the other is the rating of users to these movies. Since this example is explained in the lab, you are expected to create a new notebook file and explain the code. Submit your code result and report in jupyter notebook format. The more complete your report and your explanation about the codes, the more perfect score you will receive. The required files are attached as zip files.

`movies.csv file`

- movieId: Movie ID
- title: title of the movie
- genres: movie genre

`rating.csv file`

- userId: User ID
- movieId: The ID of the movie that the user rated
- rating: the score given by this user to the movie
- timestamp: the exact time of registering the user's points
